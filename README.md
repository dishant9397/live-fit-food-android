* The Android application is able to facilitate users for picking up ordered meals from the nearest store.
* Users are also provided an option to login with the help of phone number.
* Discounts are applied subject to more number of months ***i.e.*** 6 months plan would get at more discounted price than plan for one month.
* There are two versions of this application:  
    1. Admin: 
        * Administrator can manage meals by performing CRUD operations on meal, along with adding images for particular meal.
        * In addition, admin user can also view confirmed and picked orders by tapping on "Confirmed Orders" and "Picked Orders" respectively.
        
    2. User:
        * User can view additional meal details and confirm an order by looking at list of all meals.
